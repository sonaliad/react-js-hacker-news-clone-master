## Technical Overview

The idea behind this project is to design the clone of hacker news website using react.js with Server-side rendering technique and the application modules bundled using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) Javascript module bundler and it uses [babel-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/babel-loader/) to load the plugins with the given presets. 

To populate the votes in a line chart, it uses [react-chartkick](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartkick) npm modules.

And the application has been built with [Travis-CI (continuous integration)](https://travis-ci.com/) and deployed to [Heroku](https://hackernewsonali.herokuapp.com/).
